    "This notebook describes the step-by-step procedure required to improve the reduction of darks and include these in the reduction of a set of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)/UVIS observations. This is based on the STScI standard darks reduction pipeline as copied from GitHub 19th April 2019. All changes made to the ST codes should be denoted by \"LP\" in the comments. Written by Laura Prichard April–November 2019.\n",

    "    - lp_darks/ – copy of the st_darks/ directory that was edited.\n",
    "    - mr_darks/ – copy of Marc Rafelski's codes and reference tables some of which were implemented in the lp_darks/ version of the ST pipeline.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    - the directory of the main codes for the pipeline (cal_uvis_make_darks/, main code is cal_uvis_make_darks.py), \n",
    "    - a folder for reference tables i.e. dark_lookup.txt (ref_files/),\n",
    "    - a folder for terminal outputs for the codes (logs/),\n",
    "    - a code to download data with astroquery and organize files ready for reduction (download_data.py), \n",
    "    - a code to CTE correct science data (ctecorr_scidata.py),\n",
    "    - and this notebook (darks_reduction.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "The darks codes are kept in a root directory `darks_red_pack/` along with the data directory e.g., `darks_data/`.
